# Linux CPU Temperature Driver

This repository contains the source code and instructions for creating a Linux kernel module to read the CPU temperature. The module creates a `/proc/cpu_temp` file, which provides the current temperature of the CPU when read.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to provide a detailed guide for implementing a Linux kernel module that reads the CPU temperature. Monitoring the CPU temperature is crucial to ensure optimal performance and prevent damage from overheating. This guide covers the key concepts and techniques needed to create, compile, and load a kernel module that reads the CPU temperature and displays it in the `/proc` filesystem.

## How It Works

### Module Creation

- During module loading, a file named `cpu_temp` is created in the `/proc` directory.
- The module interacts with the Linux thermal zone interface to get the CPU temperature.
- The temperature is read and provided to the user or application that reads the `/proc/cpu_temp` file.

### Thermal Zone Interface

- The Linux thermal zone interface is used for monitoring and managing the temperature of system components, including the CPU.
- The module uses this interface to get the current CPU temperature and returns it in degrees Celsius.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- **Flexibility**: Kernel modules can be added or removed without rebooting the system.
- **Efficiency**: Modules are only loaded when needed, freeing up system memory when not in use.
- **Development and Testing**: Modules facilitate the development and debugging of new kernel functionalities.
- **System Information**: Provides useful information about the CPU temperature for system monitoring and overheating prevention.

### Disadvantages

- **Stability**: Errors in kernel modules can cause system instability or crashes.
- **Security**: Kernel modules run with elevated privileges, making them potential targets for exploitation.
- **Compatibility**: Modules must be compiled for the specific kernel version in use.
- **Complexity**: Developing kernel modules requires a deep understanding of the operating system and C programming.
